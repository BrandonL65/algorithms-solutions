  Difficulty: Easy

  Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the
  maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array.
  If a sum can't be generated, the function should return 0.
  
  Sample Input
  array = [75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]

  Sample Output
  330, which is 75+120+135
